            #### Project Overview
            This project demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP) and federated learning can address privacy concerns in medical text analysis.

            **Key Features**:
            - **Privacy-Preserving Learning:** Ensures sensitive medical data remains private using federated learning.
            - **Differential Privacy:** Protects against privacy attacks by adding controlled noise to data and model updates.
            - **Medical Text Analysis:** Performs multi-class classification on medical research abstracts.
